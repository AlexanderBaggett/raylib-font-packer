# Raylib Font Packer
This is a simple tool I wrote to allow you to pack handmade fonts, especially ones that don't result in optimal file size to move them to a square image that is rounded to the nearest power of 2 for both dimensions and put them in an Indexed png with only 2 bit depth (thus reducing file size).
